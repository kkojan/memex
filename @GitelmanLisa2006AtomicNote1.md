Media in this article is described loosely as a set of different mediums (and hence the word media is in plural) and is described to have an overarching reach on humans across the world. In this specific quote, it shows how the internet in this case is a very powerful medium that is capable of not only surviving through different events, but also being very effiecient and helpful for human life as it is shown to have a lot of power as well (the author references it as being capable of surviving thermonuclear war in this case, it is that strong). This also could beg to ask the question on how human life would have been had it not been for the internet, instead with a bigger reliance on other forms of media not including the internet, as it is kind of now more of a centralized hub especially when compared to the other medias due to its vast popularity amongst humans.
