This was an interesting point to discuss as the use of OTPs (One time passwords, today) are still relevant and weaves in some of the ideas of the One time pads OTP. OTPs today provide a password which is used one time only for cofidential things such as for a bank account or making a secure payment. What is interesting about this is that it is implying the basic principles of a cipher, in that it is providing a key that is unique (as a cipher is unique to its own key as well) and that is only exclusive to one person, as is a cipher. It is definitely interesting to see how these sorts of ideas have been around for a long amount of time and how they are able to evolve as well as time goes on to be able to be implemented with the same core reasons as they were in the past but on a more modern front.
