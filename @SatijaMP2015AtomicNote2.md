The above quote poses an interesting future direction in that perhaps a different sort of organizational method than that that was made by Melvil Dewey and his classification system could be more effecient? Dewey's method involves classifying texts into their different topics and categorizing them relative to that, whereas a alphabetical and linear way would be less relevant to the topic that is at hand but just in sheer alphabetical order. This could have its benefits in that it isn't subjective to topics anymore (different topics can be categorized differently for others). However, this can lead to a more jumbled up and possibly disorganized system due to the fact that all the different topics will be more scattered. However it would be interesting to research and discuss the different ramifications for using different kinds of sorting, and to compare the pros and cons of using either an alphabetical system or a more categorical system more similar to that that Dewey had created and is currently being used too.
