Here in the text, the author mentions how new information and statistics led to them being debunked on an opinion that they had. This is interesting, as it ties back to the questions posed in [[@CaufieldBush2015AtomicNote1]] where it was asked why people effectively choose to seek out information that they tend to generally agree with. It is definetly and interesting aspect of the human mind, as people tend to go out of their way to find out information that may not necessarily be agreed on in the general population but for the,. which can lead to surprising situations such as the one above. The above quote also goes to show how there is more than what meets the eye and a little bit of complexity is necessary when trying to figure out a theory or do research, as this would lead to more intricate results.
