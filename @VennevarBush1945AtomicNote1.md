This part of the article is important, as it discusses and hints at how new mediums and methods are essential for spreading research and information around for newer generations. This line also hints at the need and want for a new method to spread information that is more viable for future generations and efficient to be able to spread things around the world. As time goes on, other factors such as technology need to make sure that they are able to keep up as that is essential for the growth and development of humanity (along with science, which is mentioned in the article too and the needs and advancements/uses of them in the war that was occuring at the time). By introducing new methods and ways to study research and other results, it ensures that humans transition to newer generations more smoothly and it also establishes a greater unity among us as it is easier to share important information across the world and not just locally.
