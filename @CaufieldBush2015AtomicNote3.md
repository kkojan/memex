Trying to keep the internet more relevant for the general pool of knowledge as opposed to continuously opposing each other

This annotation links back to the other two notes as will be linked below (see related links) as it ties in with a similar theme. The theme that this ties around to is how people will tend to gravitate towards information that is more accepting of what they believe to be is correct and then go from there and try to argue that, even though it may not be correct to the general public. This quote effectively challenges that and essentially seems to be promoting a kind of open mindedness where people are entitled to believe and want what they want to know, but at the same time maintain some sort of general pool of knowledge for other generations and others in order to help them to formulate opinions. A future direction to help this out is to clearly establish information and research to the public and to avoid misinformation.
