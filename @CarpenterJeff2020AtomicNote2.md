Possibly the start of using computers for different ciphers?

This annotation is definetly an interesting one as it can pose a question in this case. That question being the importance of computers in the evolution of ciphers? In the article, it is mentioned that there is a more rapid evolution of ciphers with the introduction and invention of computers (and around the time of the internet). This didn't occur in just regular computers though, but also those that were found in military vehicles such as older tanks especially of those of the Germans. This in mind, it essentiallys helps to beg the question on the relevance of ciphers in terms of computers and how computers have helped to enhance either their security (i.e. made them harder to de-code) and just the full extent of impact that the invention of computers has had on them.
