could help to create redundancy which in turn could make a more reliable sort of data transmission (ie if one signal got cut then theres other streams to get information from)

The above quote and the surrounding information are interesting in that they talk about the need for a distributed network that can use multiple pathways to distribute packet information from the host to the recipients device. This is really important to have (especially in a time of war or when it is dire to have it) due to the fact that if it isn't distributed, crucial time can be lost due to lag time or overclogging of the one pathway being used in a communications setting. While when it's more distributed, it's almost like there's more redundancy in that if one path gets laggy, other ways can be taken as well to speed up the sharing of information.
