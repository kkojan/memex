> The biggest difference between those dial-up bulletin boards and servers of today is in the way people connect and (because of that) how many people could connect at once.[^1]

This part of the source is very interesting as it talks about how there are similarities between the BBS and the modern day servers that are used today. It talks about how there were both similarities and differences and through that as well as supplementary information, it would be quite interesting to map down and look at the timeline of internet creation and expansion relative to the expansion of BBS servers and different sorts of inventions that ran parallel with the BBS servers that can relate to the internet and could potentially pave the way to the creation of the internet.
