This could be really important in catering the creation of modems (and in turn, influencing what is invented based off the modem) towards those who would be the target demographic (for example hobby radio groups, computer clubs) as well as those who have more financial support to be able to bring in more experienced computer progammers to help them with the creation of the modem too.
