This above quote is interesting to look at as it discusses how certain factors can help facebook make communication possible and take control of that communication too. This is interesting especially when the context of the quote is considered as it draws parrellels between facebook (which is a relatively new social media) with older kinds of communication techniques such as BBSes that had previously existed. It is always interesting to see the correlation between an older form of technology and media and compare it to something that is new and being developed.
