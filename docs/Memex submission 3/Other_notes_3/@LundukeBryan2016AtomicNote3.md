This quote from the article is very appealing as it provides the insight that it is quite simple to get in the BBS and use them. This would mean that coupled with the fact that it was almost groundbreaking technology that was new (almost like communitites) as well as helped connect people way easier, could have had a great appeal and a surge in users. Since it was easy to access, that meant that a lot more people could access it and have their feedback on the BBS to be able to help develop it into something bigger and invent other things based off this (which could have helped the development and pushing of internet based instant messaging). Due to the appeal and relatively straightforward nature of the BBS system, it would have had more population which could help develop it more.
