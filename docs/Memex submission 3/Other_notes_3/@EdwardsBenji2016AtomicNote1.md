This quote above is very interesting as it mentions how things on BBSes would remain even after a long time, which is reminiscent about an idea that is prevalent today. That idea being of a digital footprint that means that once someone says or does something online, that it never really gets deleted and will always be there. It is very interesting to see how this theory kind of maintained itself and was a thing back even before the internet actually started and a main way of communication between people on computers was through these BBSes instead of instant messengers which were created later on with the emergence of the actual internet.
