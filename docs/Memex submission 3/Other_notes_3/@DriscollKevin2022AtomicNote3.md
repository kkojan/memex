The above quote is also an interesting one as it discusses how the earlier bulletin boards were created and what they did and who they catered to. Essentially they helped people with similar hobbies, interests and other characteristics have a platform in which they could communicate with each other and be able to spread and share their own ideas amongst each other. This is interesting as this sort of system has been an evolving one, as we've seen websites that follow this sort of theme or idea sprouting over time, including websites like reddit and other potentially controversial ones such as 4chan.
