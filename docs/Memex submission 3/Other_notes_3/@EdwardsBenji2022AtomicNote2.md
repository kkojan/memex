Even though nowadays there's nationwide calling, this is still sort of a relatable problem that can occur in that long distance calls are relatively expensive and so best way of communication with those in other countries is through the internet

In the above quote, it talks about how long distance calls were really expensive so these bulletins were created to be able to help people communicate with each other and not have to pay those fees. This sort of problem again can lead to a solution which was the creation of these boards, which then would evolved as the internet evolved too and it would lead to the creation of other forums. These forums again are seen today such as reddit. The concept of these sorts of forums have similarities and a very similar backbone to those that were relevant back in the 80s. Communication these days is also done over the internet more often as it is free now and long distance phone calls are still relatively expensive.
