ups communication even for those who were further away

## Source 
> If you sent an email to a user on a different BBS, that user wouldn't be able to read that email until the two BBS systems performed a regular (often once per night) connect to trade emails with each other.[^1]

This part of the above source is very interesting as it mentions that it was possible for people to communicate from great distances with each other, granted it took some time for the messages to get across to others. This could have been the initial spark (or part of the initial spark) that led to the creation of social media as it is today, as well as the capabilities to not just talk to people across the country, but across the planet as well. Granted, it did take time to develop and send messages across BBS servers, but it could have led to individuals working on a more efficient way to send messages long distance without the lag time and that could have helped to create instant messaging. More research can be done in the field regarding how these BBSes were able to contribute to the development of modern day social media and instant messaging too.
