This above quote is particularly interesting. This is due to the fact that it talks about how connecting to computers was done through the telephone cable through these sorts of BBSes, even though the internet had technically not been officially launched just yet. This also is interesting given the fact that very early models of the internet (ie dial up internet) had also utilized using telephone cables as well (meaning that one could not use the phone and internet at the same time). It is quite interesting to see the build up from BBSes to dial up internet as they both use the same idea in that they both use telephone cables to convey data to each other.
