In the above quote, it talks about how only one telephone line could be used for one device to connect to the internet, and if that device was used for telephone calling then it would disconnect the internet line. This was a prevalent problem even in my household growing up as we had a dial up modem up until around 2008 when we upgraded and got an internet router instead. Problems like this are very prominent in that they can help pave the way for a creation to a solution to the problem, which in this case would be the development of a router that is able to connect without the use of the telephone cable and keep the telephone connected while using the internet and internet capabilities and servers as well.
