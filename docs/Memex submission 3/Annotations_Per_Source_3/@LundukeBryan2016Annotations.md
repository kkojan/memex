seems like the bulletins from back then evolved into what we have today
&mdash;[[]]

> The biggest difference between those dial-up bulletin boards and servers of today is in the way people connect and (because of that) how many people could connect at once.[^1]

## Source 
> If you sent an email to a user on a different BBS, that user wouldn't be able to read that email until the two BBS systems performed a regular (often once per night) connect to trade emails with each other.[^1]

very easy to enter meaning a lot of people could use it and since it's practical, it can lead to rapid development
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> The barrier to entry was astoundingly low for hobbyists and amateur computer users to set up and run their own BBS.[^1]
