**What is the most powerful thing you learned in this course?**

In my opinion the most powerful thing that I learned in this course is how interlinked everything can be not just when it comes to the history of the internet, but with how it links all different bits of history together and how that is able to form a massive linkage throughout the history of humans and society as a whole which also along the way of the evolution, creates new things. 

One particular aspect that I found extremely powerful and interesting is how many aspects of computers and what makes a computer very great (or just what makes a computer a computer) has been around for a long time throughout human history. For example, communication is a big part of computers and modern day technology. They allow us to communicate easier and more efficiently with each other through waves and in the internet. It also allows us to talk to people regardless of the distance that they are in the world. Before, even dating back to more ancient civilizations, we have been able to see that communication through their own respective techniques do have sorts of similarities with what computers do today, and there are more and more similarities with them and computers as time goes on. For example, it could have started out with sending a messenger man to send messages to different villages, to carrier pigeons sending letters further to the internet/computers sending messages across continents. As there is much more to it, there are similarities over these three methods though they were probably employed and used over thousands of years. 

To me what is extremely fascinating about this whole process is that there are points where you can see a clear correlation between these different methods and that this is a major point to what makes history in general so fascinating. With all the new technology that is out now and has been released, there is always some sort of linkage between all the different steps that it had taken in history that relates it in a sort of linear (but not really so linear) pathway. In other words, so much of our advancements today had originated throughout history. A problem would pose itself, and thus humans in their respective time would start to work on a solution to help aid with solving this problem that they have. Then, they will take what they invented and refine it in order for it to become more and more efficient and this process will go on (and will never really stop, even nowadays our inventions and technology is and always will be refined for future generations and attempted to "get better", for lack of a better word). Then, as this goes on you can roughly begin to map out a pathway in this. Throughout this memex for example, you can see different links to different topics that revolve around a similar theme, and it can help map this pattern out. For example, it mentions ciphers and ancient communication techniques all the way up to other long distance communication techniques used in world war one, to virtual chat rooms and boards used in the 90s to social media today.

This has always been a huge interest for me in terms of history classes and learning history, to be able to deduce a pathway between the diferent events as that is a sort of cornerstone to history and learning history. A lot of the times, a big part of history boils down to learning about cause and effect (i.e., how certain events lead up to other events and how we can learn from that) and usually in school we look at how negative events happened and analyse those and hwo they can be avoided in the future. That being said, it is a lot more interesting to look at the different cause and effects that we can find throughout history (and in this case, in the history of the internet) and how that contributes to what we have today and what we will having going forward as well, as the world is very dynamic and time will always go on and bring new things, so it is important for us to reflect on what we already have and see how we can do things better and go from there. Seeing this through the context of the internet and computers has to be the most powerful thing that I had learned in this class.
