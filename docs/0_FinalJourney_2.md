**Did you meet your goals for this course? Why or why not?**

My goal in this course was to look at the advancements and events that had taken place in human societies over the years and put it all together in order to deduce how all the events related to (and preceding) computers and more specifically, the internet (along with other digital technology that we have today including things like communication devices and methods) and how those sorts of inventions over time were built off of each other through different links together, and how it essentially all helped to culminate together and create something even more vast (which in this case is the internet). Through this scope, I feel like that I was able to meet my main goal for this class, which is to deduce the preceding steps to the creation of the internet as well as take a look at and study the creation and emergence of the internet as well as other technology like computers. 

Throughout the course, I was able to look at the historical events (it's a bit hard to call them events as it was more of a timeline and it is not easy enough to just say that it was a series of events as there was a lot more to it than just events) leading up to the emergence of the internet and computers in today's society. One way in which I was able to look at this for my goal was that I was able to see how different technologies that had been around  that are related to computers had been able to evolve and develop in order to help facilitate the creation of the computer and the internet. It was a sort of cause and effect chain, where it would be that there would be a need for something (such as a code to be able to speak amongst each other without being able to be understood what is being said by "outsiders" or people who are not involved/shouldn't be involved, or ciphers) and how something to help solve this problem would emerge. However then over time and in this class, I was able to look at how different inventions and aspects related to computers (for example as mentioned before, ciphers) were constantly developed and refined in order to constantly become something better, eventually leading up to the creation of a computer. This was then coupled with the emergence of technology that would lead up to the internet.

Another way in which i was able to accomplish my main goal was to look at different historical events and how those led to the speeding up of the creation of the internet. Again, going back to the point about history being a big cause and effect loop, certain events and certain times lead to situations where inventions are required or would either be essential to society or would give someone or something a massive advantage. That will be created and refined by society in general if it has benefits and will continue to progress as long as it is shown to be benificial. This is also prevalent with the creation of the internet and computers. For example, a need for more efficient communication was needed during world war I. Through using different communication technology using radio waves for long distance communication, a more efficient method to communicate had been introduced and that is built off of. Big storage archives for digital data was also created as it helped to be able to store massive amounts of data without taking up too much physical space (as much as it would take up if the data stored was not all digital). That being said, it was very interesting to see how events that aren't directly related to computers help contribute to the creation of computers and different storage methods, and in turn help indirectly create the internet and continue to advance it as well. 

That being said, I believe myself that I was able to accomplish the goals that I had in mind when signing up and starting this class. I think that I was also able to accomplish this in a traditional way where I was able to look at the different cause and effect (or chain reactions) reactions that would have pushed towards (or even indirect events that would accelerate the process, such as other world war I or other significant events like such) the creation of the internet. I was also able to look at how different processes would interlink with each other in order to create a rough sort of timeline at the different that had occured in order to facilitate the creation of the internet as well as like technology including computers. This can even be taken further in the sense that now with this, we can try to map out how other technology related to the internet and computers were impacted also by these factors (for example, how events leading up to the creation of the internet impacted the creation of other technology such as cellphones).
