All of these sources tie together in a loop in a way. These sources talk about mainly communication tools that had evolved from the American Civil war up until world war 2, which paints a full circle picture of how these communication tools were evolving, enhanced and built off of when it comes to making them more refined and better. This applies to the creation of computers as some of the sources analyzed too talk about the early days of the computer and the development of it, which had a similar development to these different technologies and in a similar way, which would be how different pieces of evolution and technology from different places would inspire new ideas and be put together in order to create a big picture idea and lead to these new revolutionary inventions. These could also be applied in the future to lead to the creation of even more inventions as well that will help us.
