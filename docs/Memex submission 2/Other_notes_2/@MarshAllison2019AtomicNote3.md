As mentioned previously, a possible future direction that can come as a result of successfully building the transatlantic line permenantly is to potentially see how it can be utilized in the future. That being said, it is interesting to see how this technology will be used in the future. Further research in this topic will be interesting. For example, given how they were able to run a wire underwater connecting two countries almost 150 years ago, could it be possible to establish some sort of wireless framework that kind of works like this cable through two connecting ports but between planets instead, as space exploration has become more and more a researched and explored topic to this day? It will be very interesting to see what they can do with this technology in the future and the future plans regarding this.

This [link](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/space-communications-7-things-you-need-to-know) is interesting because it talks about communication in space between astronauts. Could similar ways to the transatlatic cable be encorporated with this method of communication and can that be utilized in the future for interplanetary communication?
