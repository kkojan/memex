In this quote, it is talked about how the new communications technology that had been utilized could branch out to North America. During a time like this with the context of wireless technology not being as advanced, having any sort of advantage is massive. Being able to also advance even more and build off something like this can lead to even bigger advantages for you and your country in the context of events at the time. Being able to establish communication all the way out to North America is vital, meaning that communications with the United States and Canada (two key allies with the Allies) as well as other vital countries there is very important, and to be able to have this long distance communication with each other is massive. This is also shown through how Germany eventually would try to contact Mexico for an alliance which was intercepted by Britain which wanted to help Mexico regain lost territory from the United States in exchange for an alliance system, which was known as the Zimmermann Telegram.
