Based on the quote above, it essentially helps to show that wireless communication had come a long way and had become "easier" to use, so to speak. Different technologies seem to be emerging at this point (for example telegrams with the finishing and utiliziation of the transatlatic cable) such as telegrams and radio communication. These communication methods also were wireless and provided different modes of communication among the population. It was interesting to see and study the different kinds of and different sources of communication in that timeframe as well as study and look at how they operate and function.
