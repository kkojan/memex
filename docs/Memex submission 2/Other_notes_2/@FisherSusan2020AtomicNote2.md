The above quote talks about how there is a massive surge in computers in households in Canada as well as other mobile computing devices (such as cellphones) and other computer related tchnology such as the internet. This is interesting in the context of this article due to the fact that throughout the article, it discusses how computer usage and ownership had increased over the years. This in turn can lead to the deduction that computers had an increased use over the yeras as well as there had been a transition over to them. This would signify the importance and reliance that had been growing on computers as the years went on, and in the future this reliance could be studied and looked into as a future study.
