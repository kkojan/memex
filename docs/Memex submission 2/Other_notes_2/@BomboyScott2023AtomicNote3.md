This point brings up an interesting suggestion for a follow up research. For this, it is mentioned how Germany wanted Mexico to essentially switch sides and be on the side of the Mexicans and Germans, as they allied with the allies (though didn't have much of an effect). This sort of communication with an ally would be highly controversial meaning that Mexico, if they had accepted, would only be able to communicate through secrecy with Japan. This could lead to a question on how they planned to communicate like this with Japan and maintain that sort of secrecy that they would probably have hoped to maintain. Would it have been through telegram communication or what other methods could they have used instead?
