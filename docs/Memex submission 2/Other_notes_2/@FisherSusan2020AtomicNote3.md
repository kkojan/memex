> The introduction of computers into public schools, where they had been rare, began in earnest during this decade[^1]

The above quote is interesting in that it discusses how computers had started to be introduced into other public sectors. It had transitioned from having heavy use within the government and businesses to more personal usage. This was around the time that the PC was created (which is a personal computer) which were smaller, more compact and easier to fit inside a house or other public areas such as a school. The relevance that this quote has is that it mentions how rare and scarce computers were in being used in this area or for this kind of usage, while that had started to grow as the century moved on.
