This quote is interesting as it discusses how computers even when they started and were invented, provided sort of a beacon for future generations. This quote talks about how despite its simplicity, the computer was a door opening to a a whole new world because of its discovery and innovation and that that comes with the invention of the computer. This shows and is symbolic to how vital and how big of a milestone it was with the invention of this also for Canada as well, to be able to create such a vast machine that was the cornerstone of creating essentially a new world (now we can see the cyberworld starting with everything translating over to computers). It really goes to show how powerful and symbolic the invention of the computer was and how vital it was to have something like this be invented and utilized not just in Canada, but for humans as a whole.
