This part of the article is an interesting part to point out as it ties together with the other parts of other sources explored. It discusses the different problems that had began with the evolution of computers. Before during world war one and even before that especially with wireless communication, there had always been privacy issues and concerns that different transmitions or broadcasts could be intercepted, hijacked or there could be a disturbance to it. It is really interesting to see how this had exasperated as time went on and had evolved as computers had also evolved too. Perhaps the study of how there may be different and newer problems with computers could be done next and further study on this matter as well.
