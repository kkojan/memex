How much of the use of telegraphy was the basis to radio communication in world war 1?
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> The most common forms of wartime communication were the spoken word, newspapers, mail, written reports and dispatches, and telegraphy.[^1]

In the above passage from the source, it talks about the most common used methods of communication in the civil war. It mentions (and the article in general) about how telegraphy was a major source of communication as it was a lot more efficient particularly for long distance communication as it was able to send and relay messages a lot quicker and more efficient than having someone physically deliver a message themselves. A point that can be further studied could be to explore the question that to what extent did the technology found in telegraphs lead to the creation and invention of the new methods of communications that we developed and are still developing (for example, radio transmissions and whichever next method of communication could later be created in the future).
