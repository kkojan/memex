In the above quote (and annotation) that is provided above, it is discussing how the older versions of communication had started to phase out during world war one in exchange for newer, more effecient methods to communicate (one of those being via wireless communication). This sort of advancements are key and crucial when it comes to situations like this in order to gain a very strategical and big advantage compared to your opponents. That being said however, it would lead to a very interesting rabbithole so to speak, in order to look at, study and analyse how this switch to wireless telegraphy had an impact on the further advancing of wireless technology as a whole and make connections (for example you could study how these sorts of advancements could have led to different technologies such as wireless internet today and so on). This is definitely a point that can be further studied and looked into to provide further insight.
