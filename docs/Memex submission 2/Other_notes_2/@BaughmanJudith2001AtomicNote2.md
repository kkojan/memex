In the following quote, it mentions how the sales of radios had risen by 1400% and how much it made it sales. This massive surge would emphasize the importance and need/want for wireless communication. This massive spike could be that the efficiency of wireless communication was seen in war and so companies had decided to try to push the same aspects that were successful in war to the general population, which was very well recieved. This also would have been promoted further by the fact that there was massive economic prosperity in the United States at the time from the war, which led those who had wealth (and more people had more disposable wealth at that time due to the circumstances) to spend on a lot of extra items that they didn't necessarily need but wanted. Radios however still will be seen to have a big importance even today.
