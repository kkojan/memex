The above quote is very interesting because it shows how part of the computer (which they sometimes would call a brain) was actually utilized and used as part of an arcade machine. This can go to show how different technology and inventions can be used and advanced in order to fulfill different uses. This begs the question in that how could computers of later generations been utilized to have different functions, as well as how computers today could be utilized in newer and sharper inventions? This could be a point of reference to build off of in order to create new technology and be more efficient when it comes to having new technology to work off of.
