This point that the article mentioned brings up an interesting point when it comes to history and discussing the creation of new inventions throughout the course of history such as this. What's interesting is a lot of times with inventors of ambitious projects, the creators will look ahead for future developments of what their project could be and often times those ideas that they had will come to fruition in the future. It is very interesting also considering their optimism that they had in their time even though it may have been seen as unrealisitic ends up occuring. It would be quite interesting to study how these sorts of ideas or "wishful thinking" at the time from these inventors actually leads to the development and invention of new products and ideas.
