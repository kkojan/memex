The note above from the source discusses how the radio and telephone (plus movies) and wireless communication basically had a massive impact on the United States during the roaring twenties. It was able to communicate massive populations within the united states with each other and even across the country too. It also allowed people to be able to stay up to date with events in the country through tuning in to the news as well as other sorts of updates on their radios. This also allowed for easier and more efficient communication to other people. This then leads to the point that how this could have created a more cultural shift towards phones and radios and the implications that this could potentially have on the furthering of communications technologies. Futher study could go into this.
