Use of ciphers, how could that lead to newer advancements and technology?

This above is really interesting as it relates information and content from part 1 of the class to part 2 of the class. Ciphers was a subject that had been studied previously. Ciphers were still also really important and useful as they helped to deduce telegraphs that had been sent (for example a very notable example is the Zimmermann Telegram which was deciphered and passed on the the United States by the British essentially). Linking these two topics is a very interesting scope to link the two parts and the two topics that had been studied in class. It also shows the linear nature of how complex inventions could link together to create one big picture, which is a big theme when it came to developing computers as many different components from different parts of the world would come together to help create computers in different countries.
