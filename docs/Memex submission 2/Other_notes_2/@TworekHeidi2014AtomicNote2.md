In this above quote, it is really interesting to investigate how the British actually seemed a bit reluctant at the start of the war, especially when in the paper how it discusses how the British soldiers were skeptical and questioning the use of heavy wireless communication tools as opposed to their preinstalled communication centers instead. This, coupled with the fact that the Germans had used this technology first and revelled in it almost had led to an advantage on this front from the Germans over the British, which would go on to highlight the significance of wireless communication. This would not only help in war, but could go on to help with other global affairs and intercontiental communications amongst countries and allies for example (like from Europe to North America). A efficient and sophisticated communication technique could be the decision maker in a big event such as a world war. It could also help leada to the invention and creation of even further technologies in the future.
