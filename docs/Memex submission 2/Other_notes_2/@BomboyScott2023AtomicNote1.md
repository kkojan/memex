The Zimmerman telegram in this war in regards to the themes discussed in class is very interesting. It is to me because it was one of the first instances of a country defying another on a massive global stage through the use of wireless communication methods, so to speak. Germany had tried to send a telegram to Mexico however as it was relayed through Britian, it was intercepted there and handed to the United States. This to me provides interesting insight in terms of the pros and cons of wireless communication methods that were available in world war one and to be able to analyse those different methods as well to deduce their efficiency, usefulness and so on. It could also provide a framework to be able to build off of for further generations to help them get more advanced technologically.
