Start of de-encryption of different ciphers
&mdash;[[]]

## Source 
> Islamic scholar and polymath Al-Kindi devised a way to break classical (monoalphabetic) substitution ciphers (like the Caesar cipher) in his 8th century treatise,[^1]

The point being made here is very interesting in the context of how ciphers are used for more classified messages to be sent and that there had been a breakthrough in technologies in order to decode and read different ciphers. Given that that had became possible, it shows that there is a clear weak point and it's interesting given the invention of computers and the question of how efficient they can be at breaking other ciphers and encryptions and the speed that they can do them at. If computers evolve to become very efficient at this, it could lead to huge strategical advantages in terms of being able to adapt quickly to different ciphers in order to decode them fast, which can lead to multiple advantages in any given context that they are used in and the situation that they are needed for.
