Rapid evolution of appendixes since the invention of the computer

>While librarieshad been using COM for book form catalogueproduction and other technical service applicationssince 1960s, widespread implementation of COMcatalogues began only in the mid-1970s

The above quote fits in well with the theme of the class as well as with the overall themes of the paper at the same time. It discusses the importance of having a good organizational system in the confines of education systems such as a library in this case, as well as the importance of computers (and potentially to a relative degree, the internet if it is involved with these catagorization and appendixes). A question that can be asked is whether or not the internet can be more incorporate in order to create an even newer system to help with the catagorization and creation of new appendicies in libraries to make their organization even more efficient. It's also a question on whether this is genuinely a feasible idea that could enhance the use of appendicies even more than the are now or perhaps create a new kind of way for an even better system of organization.
