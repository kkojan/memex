Key research is lost because there isn't really a strong means of being able to share research yet

In this annotation, the author is discussing how even key areas of science had been lost due to the lack of means to be able to spread data. This then leads to certain information not being able to be spread to areas where it really matters and where it needs to be, which can lead to key information being lost or mistranslated. This ties back to different ideas of being able to establish solid means to be able to distribute and have data be more accessible in order for it to reach certain people that it would be beneficial to have, as mentioned in the quote above. It also alludes to a key theory developed in science and if even that were unable to be spread to those who matter, it would be a lot more difficult to spread it to the other masses as well and to others for educational purposes. A stronger means of sharing and spreading data would be needed.
