The importance of having a big medium to keep work in one area (way later would come to be the internet in this case, it is a library)

>These monasteries played a major role in education as they were the primary places for preservation and production in the middle ages

This part of the text is relatively important to the overall theme of the text as it discusses the importance of having areas where a lot of information can be put in and centralized (which in this case is the library) and the emphasis that is placed on these areas in order to provide help to people and were heavily employed for educational purposes. This ties in with the theme and later on in the paper, the author goes on to discuss the advancements made to libraries making them more effecient. Some of these advancments that would be discussed are of changes to the cataloguing system of the library, which would go on to have very big and drastic (for the better) changes to libraries not only at just the time when these changes were implented, but also for future generations as well.
