This quote and part of the text is particularly interesting as a point to expand on and research perhaps in the future. It would be definetly interesting to research this kind of organization of books as well as other ones in history and be able to compare and contrast them, as well as deduce different positives and negatives that can be deciphered from each different era and in a way, compare and contrast them to the organizational systems used today. This can also lead to potential enhancments or even new ideas and inspirations to be able to guide the organizational methods that we have today to be even more comprehensive or to be able to tweak them (and even future methods that we can develop too) to be even more efficient and better, so to speak, at organization.
