The point above is an interesting point that is mentioned in the book. It is interesting as it discusses how media is made up of all of the different mediums and that information that is accessed on it is subjective and up for the interpretation of the reader, similar to how the telescope is able to project an image and then the person using it themself has to be able to analyse the image and deduce what they are looking at themselves, leaving people (in this case as things on the internet are more subjective and opininionated rather than that that is seen physically through other mediums such as planets in a telescope) to have their own interpretation of different data and information (as well as opinions to a degree) that are present on different sorts of mediums, including the internet in this case and to be able to formulate their own opinons and beliefs on different topics.
