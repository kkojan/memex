Power of computers and ciphers together

The above quote and annotation is very interesting in the scope of ciphers and of this class. It is because throughout the article, there was a more streamlined evolution of ciphers and then suddenly there was a massive spike in the power and relevance of ciphers seen when computers were released that was much more rapid than at times where ciphers had been evolving as well. It's interesting given the rapid growth around the time where computers had been released and introduced, which in a sense can create a correlation where computers had to have some factor in this. Of course ciphers had seen some major evolution over the years, though not at the rate that was seen at this point.
