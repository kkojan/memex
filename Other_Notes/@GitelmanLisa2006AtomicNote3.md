The quote and section from the book that is presented above leads to discussion of a very interesting theme and concept of the text. It discusses how the internet is a very powerful a digitial media and could erase the concept of media given how strong it is. In this book, the author describes that media is plural and is made up of many different mediums, which leads to a more healthy society. This talks about how the internet is so powerful and given that it is just a medium, it could singlehandedly lead to the wiping of the identities of the different mediums that exist, leading to a more centralization of all of the different mediums towards the internet specifically. This can lead to other sorts of mediums losing their sort of self identity, so to speak, as the internet continues to build more and more power and dominance/centralization over other mediums (and media).
