In this quote and annotation, the author is discussing about how his opinions and ideas of online communication and collaboration has rapidly been changing over time. Throughout the article, the author is dicussing how he is naturally gravitating towards finding research that would fit his opinions and narritives (conformation bias in a sense) and how he would blog and post different posts on social media regarding these different opinions. This is particularly interesting as it could pose a potential question as to why people would have to gravitate towards things that they are more inclined to believe in, as opposed to establishing information supported by other research to be in a general pool of information, so to speak, and gravitate towards finding out and writing about things that could be seen as factual yet go against your belief system, as opposed to things that agree with you and your thought process.
