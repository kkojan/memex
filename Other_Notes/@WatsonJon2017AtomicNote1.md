The use of ciphers has been really prominant in history but it is interesting to me why they were used before. It would be more difficult to intercept important messages and it would make sense to have important messages delivered with more comprehensive security measures as opposed to it being done through a cipher, as it could also be misinterpretated. Building off this, another relevant question that can be asked is what is the likelihood of a message being misinterpreted and what impacts would this have on a message's delivery or a conversation between two with the cipher, so to speak.
