could depend on whether the library specializes in certain topics?

An interesting point to note here is relating to the potential idea that libraries can be specialized for a certain topic. If this were the case, then this could render some sort of categorical organizational methods (such as Dewey's) to be more ineffective than that of an alphabetical organizational system. This would then create the need to have a system that is more specific to that category and not a more broad one such as the one that Dewey had created. This would be interesting to research as it would need to lead up to the creation possibly of a new more specific system for the topic. However the issue with this could be that a new and different categorical system may be needed for every specialization that is slightly different, which could get incredibly complicated (and not to mention, potentially very costly too to have all the different systems tweaked for each different specialization). This ties in with another reading from the class as the author in that reading mentions how it's good to start research at a complicated level, meaning that specializations would be not as broad and thus, could make things incredibly complicated as stated above.
