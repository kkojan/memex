Importance of computers not just for the internet but for other sources of information too (i.e. libraries)

>It is a computerised catalogue of documents andreading materials available in a library

In this quote above, it is discussing how computerized catalogues had emerged and at this section, it discussed how these catalogues were very big and important for the library industry. An interesting thing about this and how it links to this class as well as themes in this class is how when the catalogues became computerized, it was able to act as a revolutionary action that was able to revolutionize the cataloguing that is used in libraries these days. It ties well given the fact that it explains the relationship between computers and libraries; in this case how it reallys helps to have computers when it comes to organizing a library. It fits in well with other themes in this class given the importance and relevance computers have in this situation, and how they have helped to essentially revolutionize catagorization among libraries (and other means of media as well).
