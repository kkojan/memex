This annotation and section of the paper is particularly interesting as it describes how this kind of information and technology has been around for a long time, but still has ways to go even though it has evolved quite a bit in more recent times. This is interesting because it also kind of highlights the evolutions that have occured in more recent times (around the last 30 to 40 years) in regards to computers and the internet specifically. Over this time, there has been a drastic development of these kinds of technologies and that this has been highlighted over different evolutions, for example in ciphers where there has been plenty of progress of evolution in them in the last 40 years or so when they have been used for thousands of years and possibly even more than that.
